 Have you ever wanted to build a mobile app that works on both iPhones and Android phones without doing double work? React Native is this framework Facebook made back in 2015 that lets you write your app in JavaScript once and run it on both platforms, no more juggling two totally different codebases and its a huge time saver. Big names like Instagram, Facebook, and Skype actually use React Native, so it cant be too bad to work with!

Compared to languages like Swift, which is only for iOS, or Kotlin, only for Android, React Native feels like all in one option, if you were using Swift and Kotlin you’d need two separate teams, or at least twice the effort, to keep both versions in sync, but with React Native you just maintain one codebase, fix a bug or add a feature and boom, it’s on both platforms, plus since it’s JavaScript, anyone with web dev experience can jump right in, no need to learn a brand-new language from scratch.

Getting React Native set up takes a few steps, but honestly it’s not too bad, first make sure you’ve got Node.js and npm installed, you probably already use them for other projects, then install the React Native CLI with a quick npm command, after that just run one more command to create a new project and you’re good to go, depending on your OS you might also need Python and Java JDK8, but those are pretty common tools anyway.

One of the best parts is how friendly React Native is for developers, you don’t need separate iOS and Android teams, you also get to tap into abunch of libraries, plugins, and tutorials, plus live page reloading is great, you make a change in your code and see it instantly in your app without restarting. If you want to see someone walk through it step-by-step check out that “React Native Tutorial for Beginners - Build a React Native App” video from Programming with Mosh, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-S5a0eXPoc ,it really helped me get the hang of things!
