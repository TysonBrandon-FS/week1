1. Keep API code separate from your components

Instead of putting fetch or axios calls right inside your React components, create a separate file (or use a custom hook) just for talking to the API. That way, your components focus on showing UI, and you can update your API logic later without hunting through a bunch of component code.

2. Show users what’s happening

When you ask the API for data, there’s usually a delay. Let users know by showing a loading spinner or message. If something goes wrong, show a clear error message. Handling “loading,” “success,” and “error” states makes your app feel more put together and helps you notice problems quick.

3. Don’t fetch data more than you need to

Calling the same API over and over slows your app and wastes your speed. Use caching tools (like React Query) or React’s built-in hooks (useMemo, useCallback, React.memo) to store results and only re-fetch when necessary. This keeps your app fast.

4. Keep secret keys safe

NEVER hardcode API keys or passwords into your code. Instead, put them in environment variables (like a .env file) so they don’t end up on GitHub or in a production build. Hackers go through github projects and looks for API keys lets out in the open for melicious use.

5. Read the API docs first

Before you start coding, spenda little time to the API’s documentation. Learn about its endpoints, how it expects you to send data, any limits on how often you can call it, and how it reports errors. Understanding these details up front saves you from errors later on.

By separating your API logic, handling loading and errors, caching, protecting API keys, and knowing the rules of the API, you’ll build React apps that are easier to maintain, faster for users, and less likely to break.
